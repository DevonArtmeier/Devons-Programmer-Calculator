![Calculator](Calculator.jpg)

A quick and dirty calculator for programming purposes that I made. Supports:
* Standard mathematical operations
* Binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal numbers
* Signed and unsigned numbers
* AND, OR, and XOR operations
* Left and right bit shifting
* pow() and sqrt() functions

It's also designed for easy additions of new operators and functions.
